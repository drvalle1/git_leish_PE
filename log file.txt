If we knew z1, then we can readily estimate betas and alpha

If we know betas and alpha, how well can I estimate z?

1) found a couple of bugs with simulated data. Let's how things go once I have fixed these bugs. 
Problem still persists.

2) perhaps we should get rid of the probit formulation with latent u's. This would simplify the model somewhat
things still don't look great. Perhaps we have too many covariates

3) Decrease the number of covariates and see how things go. Still not good. What about if I fix the last alpha (the one for IP) equal to its true value? Perhaps the problem is associated with having uncertain covariates.
